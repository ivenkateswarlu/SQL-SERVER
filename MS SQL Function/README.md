This Project is about creating Scalar Valued Functions and Table Valued Functions in MS SQL

Scalar Valued Funcations: A scalar function is a type of user-defined function that returns a single scalar value based on the input parameters passed to it. The scalar function is used to perform some calculations or operations on the input parameters and return a single result https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scalar-function-in-sql-server/

Table Valued Functions: We have two Table Valued Functions
i) Inline Table Valued Function: Contains a single SELECT statement and is more efficient. We can Pass parameters to this function.
ii)MultiStatement Table Valued Function: Can have multiple statements to populate the returned table variable. We can Pass parameters to this function.
